Any change on `Object.prototype` properties will then propagate through the prototype chain inheritance to all of the objects in a JavaScript application. This in turn would allow an attacker to add new properties or modify existing properties which will have application specific implications that could lead to DoS (denial of service), authentication bypass, privilege escalation and even RCE (remote code execution) in [some cases](https://youtu.be/LUsiFV3dsK8?t=1152). \nAs an example for privilege escalation, consider a JavaScript application that has a `user` object which has a Boolean property of `user.isAdmin` which is used to decide which actions the user may take. If an attacker can modify or add the `isAdmin` property through prototype pollution, it can escalate the privileges of its own user to those of an admin. \nAs exploitation is usually application specific, successful exploitation is much more likely if an attacker have access to the JavaScript application code. As such, frontend applications are more vulnerable to this vulnerability than Node.js backend applications.",

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by specifying a crafted `sources` parameter to any of these methods, which can modify the prototype properties of the `Object`, `Function`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` objects. A public [exploit](https://hackerone.com/reports/380873) exists which performs the prototype pollution with an arbitrary key and value.\n\nThe library implementation has a bug in the `safeGet()` function in the `lodash.js` module that allows for adding or modifying `prototype` properties of various objects. The official [solution](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/90e6199a161b6445b01454517b40ef65ebecd2ad) fixes the bug by explicitly forbidding the addition or modification of  `prototype` properties.\n\nA related CVE (CVE-2018-3721) covers the same issue prior to Lodash version 4.17.5, but the fix for that was incomplete.",

Any change on `Object.prototype` properties will then propagate through the prototype chain inheritance to all of the objects in a JavaScript application. This in turn would allow an attacker to add new properties or modify existing properties which will have application specific implications that could lead to DoS (denial of service), authentication bypass, privilege escalation and even RCE (remote code execution) in [some cases](https://youtu.be/LUsiFV3dsK8?t=1152). \nAs an example for privilege escalation, consider a JavaScript application that has a `user` object which has a Boolean property of `user.isAdmin` which is used to decide which actions the user may take. If an attacker can modify or add the `isAdmin` property through prototype pollution, it can escalate the privileges of its own user to those of an admin. \nAs exploitation is usually application specific, successful exploitation is much more likely if an attacker have access to the JavaScript application code. As such, frontend applications are more vulnerable to this vulnerability than Node.js backend applications.",

If merging objects is needed, look into creating objects without a prototype with `Object.create(null)` or into freezing `Object.prototype` with `Object.freeze()`. Finally, it is always best to perform input validation with a a [JSON schema validator](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv), which could mitigate this issue entirely in many cases."

This vulnerability is only triggered if untrusted user input flows into these vulnerable functions and the attacker can supply arbitrary long strings (over 50kB) that contain whitespaces. \n\nOn a modern Core i7-based system, calling the vulnerable functions with a 50kB string could take between 2 to 3 seconds to execute and 4.5 minutes for a longer 500kB string. The fix improved the regular expression performance so it took only a few milliseconds on the same Core i7-based system. This vulnerability is easily exploitable as all is required is to build a string that triggers it as can be seen in this PoC reproducing code - \n\n```js\nvar untrusted_user_input_50k = \"a\" + ' '.repeat(50000) + \"z\"; // assume this is provided over the network\nlo.trimEnd(untrusted_user_input_50k); // should take a few seconds to run\nvar untrusted_user_input_500k = \"a\" + ' '.repeat(500000) + \"z\"; // assume this is provided over the network\nlo.trimEnd(untrusted_user_input_500k); // should take a few minutes to run\n```",

It is widely used in connected devices. \n\nThe `merge`, `mergeWith`, and `defaultsDeep`  methods in Lodash are vulnerable to [prototype pollution](https://shieldfy.io/security-wiki/prototype-pollution/introduction-to-prototype-pollution/). Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by specifying a crafted `sources` parameter to any of these methods, which can modify the prototype properties of the `Object`, `Function`, `Array`, `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` objects. A public [exploit](https://hackerone.com/reports/380873) exists which performs the prototype pollution with an arbitrary key and value.\n\nThe library implementation has a bug in the `safeGet()` function in the `lodash.js` module that allows for adding or modifying `prototype` properties of various objects. The official [solution](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/commit/90e6199a161b6445b01454517b40ef65ebecd2ad) fixes the bug by explicitly forbidding the addition or modification of  `prototype` properties.\n\nA related CVE (CVE-2018-3721) covers the same issue prior to Lodash version 4.17.5, but the fix for that was incomplete.",
