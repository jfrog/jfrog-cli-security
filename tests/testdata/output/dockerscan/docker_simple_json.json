Search for any unfamiliar processes that consume a large amount of CPU or a large amount of network traffic, and stop them.

Search for any unfamiliar binaries set to be run on startup, and remove them. On Windows, this can be facilitated with [Sysinternals Autoruns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns).\n\n##### Defining an Xray policy that blocks downloads of Artifacts with malicious packages\n\nIt is possible to [create an Xray policy](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Creating+Xray+Policies+and+Rules) that will not allow artifacts with identified malicious packages to be downloaded from Artifactory. To create such a policy, add a new `Security` policy and set `Minimal Severity` to `Critical`. Under `Automatic Actions` check the `Block Download` action.\n\n##### Contacting the JFrog Security Research team for additional information\n\nOptionally, if you are unsure of the full impact of the malicious package and wish to get more details, the JFrog Security Research team can help you assess the potential damage from the installed malicious package.\n\nPlease contact us at research@jfrog.com with details of the affected artifact and the name of the identified malicious package."

        "summary": "The RowHammer fault injection attack can theoretically lead to local authentication bypass in OpenSSH.",
        "details": "[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) is a popular open-source implementation of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, providing encrypted communication over a network.\nIt was discovered that the OpenSSH authentication logic can be susceptible in some cases to a side-channel fault injection attack. The attack can theoretically be carried out by a local attacker which eventually bypass OpenSSH authentication mechanism.\n\nThis vulnerability currently lacks widely known published exploits, and its exploitation is considered highly complex. The intricacies of the attack, combined with the absence of well-documented exploits, contribute to the difficulty in achieving successful exploitation. Furthermore, it's essential to note that the susceptibility to this vulnerability is hardware-dependent, and the success of an attack relies on probabilities associated with the specific hardware configuration. \n\nThe vulnerability is theoretically exploitable by several different ways, the only two published ways are:\n\nIn the OpenSSH function `mm_answer_authpassword()`, a stack variable `authenticated`, is assigned to the value of the function `auth_password()` which returns 1/0 and then returned. If the value of `authenticated` is 1, the SSH connection will be established. Since `authenticated` is stored on the stack, therefore in DRAM, a local attacker could flip this 32-bit integer least significant bit, thus, bypass authentication.\n\nAnother possible exploit is the `result` stack variable in `auth_password()` function. It is initialized to 0 and set to 1 if the password is correct. \nSimilarly to the previous method, this attack requires a single bit flip of the `result` variable in order for the function to return 1 and bypass the authentication.\n\nAttackers can trigger the vulnerability via a RowHammer fault injection. The Rowhammer bug is a hardware reliability issue in which an attacker repeatedly accesses (hammers) DRAM cells to cause unauthorized changes in physically adjacent memory locations.\nSimply put:\n\n* A specific register value(`authenticated`/`result` value) is pushed onto the stack during program execution. \n* The stack, where the register value is stored, is identified to be located in a memory row susceptible to bit flips (flippable row) due to the RowHammer vulnerability in DRAM.\n* The attacker performs a series of rapid and repeated memory accesses to the adjacent rows of the flippable row in the DRAM. This repeated access exploits the RowHammer vulnerability, inducing bit flips in the targeted flippable row.\n* Due to the RowHammer effect, bit flips occur in the flippable row, potentially corrupting the data stored there.\n* After inducing bit flips in the flippable row, the attacker manipulates the program's control flow to pop the corrupted value from the stack into a register.\n* The register now holds a value that has been corrupted through the RowHammer attack. Now the `authenticated`/`result` variables hold this corrupted value thus it can lead to authentication bypass, as it may impact the control flow in a way advantageous to the attacker.",
