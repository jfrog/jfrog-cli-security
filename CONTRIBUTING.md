## üìñ Guidelines

Before submitting the pull request, ensure:

- Your changes are covered by `unit` and `integration` tests. If not, please add new tests.
- The code compiles, by running `go vet ./...`.
- To format the code, by running `go fmt ./...`.

When creating the pull request, ensure:

- The pull request is on the `dev` branch.
- The pull request description describes the changes made.

Once you have completed your coding changes, it is recommended to push the modifications made to the other modules first. Once these changes are pushed, you can update this project to resolve dependencies from your GitHub fork or branch.

To achieve this, modify the `go.mod` file to point the dependency to your repository and branch, as shown in the example below:

```
replace github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-core/v2 => github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-core/v2 dev
```

Finally, execute `go mod tidy` to update the Go module files. Please note that Go will automatically update the version in the `go.mod` file.

## üè†üèóÔ∏è Local Development

To run a command locally, use the following command template:

```sh
go run github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-security command [options] [arguments...]
```

---

Please review our [Plugin Contribution](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-core/blob/dev/plugins/README.md) guide.

This project heavily depends on the following modules:

- [github.com/jfrog/jfrog-client-go](https://github.com/jfrog/jfrog-client-go)
- [github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-core](github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-core)

During local development, if you come across code that needs to be modified in one of the mentioned modules, it is advisable to replace the dependency with a local clone of the module.

To include this local dependency, For instance, let's assume you wish to modify files from `jfrog-cli-core`, modify the `go.mod` file as follows:

```
replace github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-core/v2 => /local/path/in/your/machine/jfrog-cli-core
```

Afterward, execute `go mod tidy` to ensure the Go module files are updated. Note that Go will automatically adjust the version in the `go.mod` file.

## üö¶ Running Tests

When running the tests, builds and repositories with timestamps will be created, for example: `cli-rt1-1592990748` and `cli-rt2-1592990748`.
The content of these repositories will be deleted once the tests are completed.

To run tests, use the following command:

```
go test -v github.com/jfrog/jfrog-cli-security [test-types] [flags]
```

### The available flags are:

| Flag                | Description                                                                                     |

| `-ci.runId`         | [Optional] A unique identifier used as a suffix to create repositories and builds in the tests. |
| `-jfrog.sshKeyPath`    | [Optional] Path to the SSH key file. Use this flag only if the Artifactory URL format is `ssh://[domain]:port`. |
| `-jfrog.sshPassphrase` | [Optional] Passphrase for the SSH key.                                                                          |
